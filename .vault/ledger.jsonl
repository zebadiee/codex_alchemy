{"mode": "evolve", "result": "In computer programming, recursion is a method of solving problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. It involves a function calling itself while a certain condition is accurate. Recursion can be direct (if the function calls itself) or indirect (if the function calls a different function that ends up calling the original function).\n\nTo simulate symbolic recursion, we can create a simple program, such as the factorial function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `n` is the argument that the function `factorial()` takes.\n- The base case is `n == 1`, where the function returns `1`.\n- If `n` is not equal to `1`, the function returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`. This is the recursive call to the `factorial()` function.\n\nFor example, if we call `factorial(5)`, the function would perform the following operations:\n- 5*factorial(4)\n- 5*4*factorial(3)\n- 5*4*3*factorial(2)\n- 5*4*3*2*factorial(1)\n- 5*4*3*2*1 and returns `1`.\n\nFinally, the result of `factorial(5)` would be `5*4*3*2*1 = 120`.", "timestamp": 16.030279875}
